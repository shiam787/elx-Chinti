  If a user enters their email address from the footer, sometimes they are
  redirected to the challenge page. When the new page loads the user is
  still looking at the footer, and as the footer is very large in CP this 
  obscures the captcha, hindering progress.
  This script scrolls to the top of the challenge page after a short delay.
