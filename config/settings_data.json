When choosing Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments, our assessment will not affect your credit rating. <br> <br>\nHow can I increase my chances of being accepted for Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments? <br>\nKlarna is unique and offers Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments based on a number of factors such as the order value, previous order history and item availability. If you are 18 or over, you can improve your chances of being offered Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments by ensuring you provide your full name and accurate address details and shipping to your registered billing address. All orders are assessed individually. Just because you have been accepted for a Klarna payment method before does not mean it will be offered for every order and in turn, as it is denied does not mean it will be denied for all future orders. <br> <br>\nWhat do I need to provide when I make a purchase? <br>\nIf you want to make a purchase with Klarna using Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments, you'll need to provide your mobile phone number, email address, current billing address and a debit or card card. The mobile number is required in case we need to reach you. All communications will be sent to your email address. It's very important that you give us the correct details, as otherwise you will not receive your payment schedule and any updated order information. <br> <br>\nWill a credit search take place against me? <br>\nKlarna may run so-called unrecorded enquiries (or soft credit searches) that do not affect credit scoring and are only visible to you and Klarna, but not visible to other lenders. Neither Klarna nor Chinti & Parker run credit searches against you that could impact your credit rating. <br> <br>\nWhy have I not been offered Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments? <br>\nAlthough Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments is widely promoted it is not always universally available. The Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments payment option is automatically generated by algorithms that are dependent upon a number of factors including address details, cardholder details, amount of order, the online store, previous order history and item availability. <br> <br>\nWhat are my payment options with Klarna? <br>\nPayment for your Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments will automatically be collected from the debit or credit card you entered at checkout. The first payment is taken when the order is confirmed. The second and third instalments are collected 30 and 60 days, respectively, after the first instalment. You can always monitor your paymentsâ€™ schedule in the Klarna app. <br> <br>\nWhat happens if I cancel or return my order? <br>\nAs soon as Chinti & Parker have accepted your cancellation\/return, Klarna will cancel any future scheduled payments as well as refund any amounts due. The return will be reflected in the Klarna app immediately. <br> <br>\nWhat happens if I donâ€™t pay for my order? <br>\nKlarna will automatically attempt to collect your payment for your Pay later in 3 interest-free instalments purchase at Chinti & Parker from the debit or credit card you entered at checkout. If we are unable to collect your payment on the scheduled due date Klarna will make one further attempt to automatically collect payment two days later. Should this last payment attempt fail, Klarna will issue you a statement for the full outstanding order amount which will become payable 15 days later. Klarna shall notify you when a payment is due two days in advance of attempting to collect your payment and you can always monitor the due date in Klarna app at your convenience. Your credit score will not be impacted by using Klarnaâ€™s â€˜Pay later in 3 instalmentsâ€™ product even if you have failed to pay on time. <br> <br>\nI have been asked to go to the Klarna site. Is this correct? <br>\nYou can view all of your Klarna purchases and payment schedule in the Klarna app or by logging onto Klarna.com\/uk. <br> <br>\nIs my payment information safe? <br>\nPayment information is processed securely by Klarna. No card details are transferred to or held by Chinti & Parker. All transactions take place via connections secured with the latest industry standard security protocols. <br> <br>\nCan I pay before the due date? <br>\nYes. Just go to the Klarna app or log onto Klarna.com\/uk and pay off early. <br> <br>\nHave you received my payment? <br>\nKlarna will notify you via email and push notification from the Klarna app when a payment is due and when this has successfully been collected, or in the unlikely event of your payment failing. If a payment has been collected but you have not received payment confirmation, you can always check the status of your order and payments in the Klarna app or by logging in at www.klarna.com\/uk. <br> <br>\nWhat happens to my statement, when I've returned the goods? <br>\nOnce Chinti & Parker has received the return (partial or full) and you have received their confirmation of this, an updated statement with an adjusted payment schedule will be sent to you by Klarna if you've made a partial return. With a full return, we shall refund any payments collected and cancel any future scheduled payments. You are always able to monitor the status of your order in the Klarna app. <br> <br>\nI've received a statement, but I've not yet received my goods. <br>\nIn the event that your goods have not been received please call Chinti & Parker to check on your order and delivery status. You can also contact Klarnaâ€™s Customer Service so that we can postpone the due date on your payment or put the order on hold in the Klarna app while you wait for the goods to arrive. <br> <br>\nI have cancelled my order. How long will it take until I receive my refund? <br>\nAs soon as the store has registered your cancellation or your return, the refund will be processed within 5-7 business days. <br> <br>\nI have asked for a refund. How will I be refunded? <br>\nRefunds shall be issued back to the debit or credit card which was originally entered at checkout. I havenâ€™t received an email with my statement\/payment information. You can log in the Klarna app or at www.klarna.com\/uk, where you will find all of your orders and payment schedule information. <br> <br>\nI still have questions regarding payment, how can I get in touch? <br>\nVisit Klarna app or Klarnaâ€™s Customer Service page for a full list of FAQâ€™s, live chat and telephone options. <br> <br>"

Ensure you wash your cashmere sweaters every 3-4 wears, even if not visibly stained, as moths will flock to sweaters that have any remnant of debris.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h4>1. Preparing For The Wash<\/h4> <p>Wash with specialist cashmere wash, baby shampoo, or a gentle, low-alkaline detergent. The more alkaline a detergent is, the harsher it will be on your cashmere. If youâ€™re washing more than one item, separate pieces into two piles, one light and one dark, and start with the lightest-colour styles first. Use tepid water.<\/p>\n\n<h4>2. Washing<\/h4>\n<p>Soak for at least 15 minutes and gently swish the sweater around in the soapy water.<\/p>",

Avoid rinsing under hard running water, which can stretch delicate cashmere. Very wet cashmere can take up to days to dry, so to cut the time in half, use a large salad spinner to rid off any excess water.<\/p>\n\n<h4>4. Rolling to Remove Excess Water<\/h4>\n<p>On a flat surface, place a clean white or light-coloured towel thatâ€™s large enough to accommodate the whole sweater. Starting at the top of the garment, roll the towel and the garment together, gently pressing down on the roll to help the towel absorb the water in the garment. Unroll.<\/p>\n\n<h4>5. Lay Flat To Dry<\/h4>\n<p>Lay the item flat to dry in its natural shape, so the style keeps. Do not iron â€“ it will damage the yarn. You can also place your cashmere pieces on a mesh drying rack until theyâ€™re completely dry<\/p>",

As a last resort, take the cashmere piece to a specialist dry cleaner.<\/p>\n\n<h4>7. Storage<\/h4>\n<p>Never put away cashmere dirty. Sweat, hair, and stains attract moths. Instead, store your cashmere in a drawer or storage box with cedar balls or lavender sachets, which are your best protection against moths as they donâ€™t like the smell. Remember to replace these products each season as the smell fades. If you are thinking of storing your cashmere over a longer seasonal period, place your cashmere into plastic zip bags so moths canâ€™t penetrate.<\/p>\n\n<h4>8. If You Suspect An Infestation<\/h4>\n<p>If you see a moth flying around and suspect that itâ€™s been near your cashmere, itâ€™s not too late to take preventive measures: Seal the affected items in a plastic bag and place them in the freezer for three days. Then, take out the bag out and let them your cashmere return to room temperature, wash, and lay flat to dry.<\/p>",

Back in 1998, a friend suggested we go to a five-day intensive training in Cornwall with an Ashtanga teacher called David Swenson and I just saw it as a fun opportunity to get into the practice a bit deeper and do lots of yoga. As a result of those five days, I started teaching friends and then my mum wanted me to start teaching her and her friends, and before I knew it, I got a job teaching at a small lifestyle studio. <br><br>Eventually I went and did a longer training, but it wasnâ€™t really regulated back then like it is now. I started to become really interested in pregnancy yoga so did a specialist training and then started teaching a regular pregnancy class at the Life Centre in Notting Hill where I still teach pregnancy, mother and baby, and general yoga classes today. I've also created numerous yoga DVDs so that those who can't get to classes are able to practice with me at home.",

I found that salons treated this less toxic approach as an alternative, not as their core business which I just couldnâ€™t understand because the products are so incredible â€“ theyâ€™ve been developed to be kinder to your hair and the environment and are made in the UK, in the New Forest.

We recently launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/glasshouseshop.co.uk\/products\/glasshouse-hair-hand-and-body-wash-500ml%0A\">Glasshouse Hair, Hand and Body Wash<\/a>; the inspiration behind creating it was to minimise and streamline the number of products we use on our body and that we have in our bathroom. I wanted to create a product that was suitable for the whole family. Traditionally when we think of a multipurpose product, we might believe that itâ€™s going to do one job well, but this genuinely is a great all-rounder. The formula is sulphate and sodium chloride-free and contains lots of lovely certified organic ingredients such as aloe vera, comfrey and grapefruit.",

Iâ€™d encourage finishing off the products youâ€™ve already got and replacing things one by one. If in doubt, I suggest using a little bit of coconut oil to remove makeup, apple cider vinegar as a toner and a good natural beauty oil to hydrate skin. We could all cut back on using our hairdryer a bit too, which is obviously more challenging in winter; speak to your hairdresser who can teach you how to work with your hairâ€™s natural texture without having to rely on hot tools for styling. \n<br>At the end of each day, I like to do nothing, whether that means watching television or doing a little bit of meditation. I love to be in my own space, I really value that time by myself.  \n<br><br>Find out more at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glasshousesalon.com\">www.glasshousesalon.com<\/a>",

Itâ€™s a brand that can do very chic and understated as well as colourful and fun which allows a really interesting opportunity to be creative and make beautiful product. <br><br><\/i>\nHow would you describe the Chinti & Parker woman? <br><i>Sheâ€™s me! And also, my friends. Sheâ€™s like every member of our office, to be honest. The customer is diverse and there is something in the collection for everyone. From the cashmere neutrals in essentials to the more vibrant pieces that express fun and personality. <\/i>\n<br><br>\nWhat are your favourite pieces from the AW19 collection? <br><i>Iâ€™ve worn the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/products\/black-charleston-floral-silk-dress\">Charleston floral dress<\/a> quite a lot and always get compliments and people asking where it is from. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/products\/black-colour-block-wool-twill-boyfriend-shirt\">colour-block shirt<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/search?q=eccentric&type=product\">Eccentric pieces<\/a> are great, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/products\/ginger-luxury-cashmere-rollneck-sweater\">Luxury jumper<\/a> feels amazing on. I am also in the process of acquiring every single piece from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/cashmere-essentials\">Essentials collection<\/a>, itâ€™s all beautiful. <\/i>",

Iâ€™m inspired by moments in time rather than just designers; I loved Tom Fordâ€™s Gucci, and â€˜70s YSL, Nicholas GhesquiÃ¨re at Balenciaga and Margiela for HermÃ¨s are some of my favourites. \n<\/i>",

Itâ€™s really difficult to always remain your most creative when itâ€™s your job and you need to channel it constantly, whilst also picking up on the unavoidable day to day aspects that are less creative, and more admin based. You are constantly switching your brain from one thing to the other. Because I work in fashion, if I want to be inspired, I have to step away from it. My advice is to read a book, see an exhibition, watch an inspiring film or just get out of your routine and have a change of scenery. As a designer, there are always times when you donâ€™t know how you are going to find the inspiration for the next season, but it always comes together in the end.<\/i><br><br>\nWhat words do you live by? <br><i>Treat others as you would like to be treated. <\/i><br><br>",

I recommend allowing ample time to eat your meals; spending time chewing your food properly and being mindful around your mealtimes is so important irrespective of what youâ€™re eating.
